		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This page is a portfolio highlighting the work I've done in the Thinkful program (see: "Thanks" tab for details).  It contains my favorite projects that I felt brought the most to the table in terms of educational value.  Inspiration in each project varies, all of which I won't bother getting in to.  What I will get in to, however, is the inspiration behind this page.</p>

		<p>If you didn't catch on initially, it's based off the Mortal Kombat character selection screen.  The music being from that as well, I didn't make it, don't own it, etc.  You get the picture.  I did this because I firmly believe in having fun with what you're doing.  Considering all of my projects having some weird element in them, I feel it works very well.  There were a lot of moments where I felt like I wasn't going to be able to finish something, or just got frustrated with the project entirely.  Particularly with this page, I had no idea what to do with my layout.  There's a lot of very popular styles out there, but none of which I really felt would be good for a portfolio project.  So, I wanted to do something that really took advantage of functionality, simplicity, and enjoyment of browsing the page.  I feel it's very fun to navigate, and I hope you agree.</p>

		<p>None of this would have been possible without a little help.  A lot of hours were spent trying to learn front end web development on my own, and that took me to a lot of places with bad information (building web pages out of tables.. apparently people do that).  It wasn't until I found Thinkful that I finally had a direction to go in.  The internet is a vast place of tutorials, and sometimes it can become daunting to really get on track with learning the fundamentals.  Thinkful is an online school providing courses in different areas of web development.  They help guide you through learning HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, AJAX, and messing with APIs.</p>

		<p>More than that, they assign you a mentor to work with.  And by 'work with', I don't mean you send emails to each other, you meet via Google Hangouts and talk quasi-face-to-face.  This really set it above any other web courses I'd done in the past, because no matter how well organized the information is, you will still run into problems.  My mentor has been extremely helpful and encouraging, if it weren't for that aspect, I don't know if I would have made it through the course.  Not to mention it really pressures you to get the projects done.  They offer a wide variety of courses, and I'm absolutely going back for another one to learn some back-end coding languages.  If you want to get into web development, I highly reccomend this service above others out there.  In 3 months, you could be from square-0 to square-wherever-I-am-currently.</p>
