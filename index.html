		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>This page is a portfolio highlighting the work I've done in the Thinkful program (see: "Thanks" tab for details).  It contains my favorite projects that I felt brought the most to the table in terms of educational value.  Inspiration in each project varies, all of which I won't bother getting in to.  What I will get in to, however, is the inspiration behind this page.</p>

		<p>If you didn't catch on initially, it's based off the Mortal Kombat character selection screen.  The music being from that as well, I didn't make it, don't own it, etc.  You get the picture.  I did this because I firmly believe in having fun with what you're doing.  Considering all of my projects having some weird element in them, I feel it works very well.  There were a lot of moments where I felt like I wasn't going to be able to finish something, or just got frustrated with the project entirely.  Particularly with this page, I had no idea what to do with my layout.  There's a lot of very popular styles out there, but none of which I really felt would be good for a portfolio project.  So, I wanted to do something that really took advantage of functionality, simplicity, and enjoyment of browsing the page.  I feel it's very fun to navigate, and I hope you agree.</p>
